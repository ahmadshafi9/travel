Want a Mini-Vacay on a budget?

As an international student making those long flights between Dubai and Vancouver for vacations, I kept thinking: "There has to be a way to sneak in a cool, affordable stopover without totally blowing my budget or adding a ton of extra travel time."

Turns out, manually digging through flights and destination guides is a nightmare and usually expensive. So, I decided to build my own solution! This little web app uses some smart behind the scenes magic (graph algorithms, if you're curious!) to figure out the best places you can stop over. It focuses on spots that don't add much extra distance to your main trip, making it easier to find those hidden gems for a quick, wallet-friendly getaway. Think of it as turning your travel time into extra vacation time!

âœ¨ Under the hood
    Frontend:
    HTML: Provides the foundational structure of the user interface.
    CSS: Styles the application, ensuring a clean, modern, and user-friendly experience (with a cool map background!).
    JavaScript: Handles all the dynamic interactions, input processing, and output rendering.
    
    Core Algorithm:
    Dijkstra's Algorithm: This classic shortest path algorithm is the brain of the operation, enabling the efficient calculation of optimal routes through the network of cities.
    Data Representation: City connections and distances are represented as a weighted graph, allowing for powerful algorithmic analysis.
