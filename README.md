Ever Dreamed of a Mini-Vacay on a Layover?

As an international student making those long flights between Dubai and Vancouver for vacations, I kept thinking: "There has to be a way to sneak in a cool, affordable stopover without totally blowing my budget or adding a ton of extra travel time."

Turns out, manually digging through flights and destination guides is a nightmare and usually expensive. So, I decided to build my own solution! This little web app uses some smart behind the scenes magic (graph algorithms, if you're curious!) to figure out the best places you can stop over. It focuses on spots that don't add much extra distance to your main trip, making it easier to find those hidden gems for a quick, wallet-friendly getaway. Think of it as turning your travel time into extra vacation time!
